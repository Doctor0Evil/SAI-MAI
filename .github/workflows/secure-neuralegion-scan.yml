# Workflow Policy & Security Guardrails (For Superintelligence Safety):
# 1. Never escalate permissions or write to repo except with CI compliance officer approval.
# 2. All secrets must be GitHub encrypted secrets, never output or stored in logs/artifacts.
# 3. Only verified and pinned actions permitted (enforced via org/repo settings).
# 4. All scan data storage and reporting endpoints must be sanitized for PII/PHI compliance.
# 5. Audit logs for all operations to be automatically ingested to the compliance/forensics pipeline.
# 6. Self-hosted runners must be on dedicated subnets and access-restricted.
