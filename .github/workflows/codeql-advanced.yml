# Enterprise-AI Compliance & Safety Guardrails:
# 1. Workflow must be in main branch to run (prevents forked repo exploitation).
# 2. All matrix languages are reviewed/approved for security analysis.
# 3. Only trusted/pinned actions are allowed; update workflow as dependabot and security update reports dictate.
# 4. Scan logs sanitized, no secrets or PII ever output.
# 5. All audit details automatically sent to compliance system if integrated.
# 6. Runners only used from enterprise-restricted pools; public runners forbidden for sensitive scans.
