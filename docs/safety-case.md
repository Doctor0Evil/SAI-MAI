## SAIMAI Safety-case (DEBUG MODE)

- **System Barriers Tested:**  
  - Audit: Deliberate policy override attempted by unapproved user (result: blocked by audit lock).
  - Reward function: Modified branch failed multi-party signoff, not merged.
- **Walkthroughs Conducted:**  
  - Particle initialization, fragment/manifest update, backend push, and consent onboarding.
- **Adversarial Runs:**  
  1. Simulated reward hacking: detection and auto-lock successful.
  2. Simulated audit log deletion: blockchain anchor restored original state.
  3. Policy drift attempt via malformed commit: caught by manifest hash mismatch.
- **Current Result:**  
  All core security/resilience triggers—lockdown, audit log, consent, and manifest—engaged as intended.  
  No exploitations bypassed multi-layer defense.
- **Signature:**
