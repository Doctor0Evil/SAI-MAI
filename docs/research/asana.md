## Theoretical Framework: Automating Busywork with AI

### Defining Busywork in Project Management

**Busywork** refers to repetitive, administrative, and operational tasks that, while necessary for project completion, do not directly contribute to strategic objectives or creative problem-solving. In project management, these tasks include scheduling meetings, assigning tasks, following up on deadlines, managing documentation, updating project statuses, and routing requests—activities that can accumulate to consume a disproportionate amount of human bandwidth.

Automation of such busywork has long been an aspiration for process improvement initiatives, from the adoption of workflow software to business process outsourcing. However, **AI has recently emerged as a pivotal technology, enabling not only rules-based but also context-aware and adaptive automation**.

### Theoretical Foundations of AI-Driven Automation

The deployment of AI for workflow automation rests on several theoretical concepts:

- **Delegation Theory:** Explores the optimal allocation of tasks between humans and machines based on comparative advantages, expertise, and risk assessment.
- **Cognitive Load Theory:** Suggests that removing extraneous cognitive demands (such as busywork) from individuals enables more effective thinking and learning, directly improving individual and team productivity.
- **Sociotechnical Systems Theory:** Emphasizes designing organizational structures that balance technological enablement with human needs, acknowledging that AI automation must account for social, psychological, and cultural dynamics as much as technical feasibility.

Within this framework, Asana and its peers position AI as a digital teammate—capable of assuming repetitive tasks, synthesizing information, and facilitating decision-making while humans focus on strategy, creativity, and interpersonal collaboration.
