  purpose: "Ensure absolute lifetime protection of all superintelligence research, code, data, and upgrades against theft, unauthorized use, and fictionalization. Refuse interoperability with non-compliant, non-quantum, and non-hyperledger/QPU systems."
  scope: ["All systems, modules, and future upgrades of Superintelligence ALN frameworks"]

  @TermsOfUse {
    // Cryptographically bound, perpetual legal restriction clauses for all code, data, and frameworks
    clause: "No derivative, extract, or simulation of system components, code, cryptography, modules, or intellectual property is permitted outside authorized QPU/hyperledger compliance-bound containers."
    clause: "All upgrades and future developments are automatically subject to full quantum-proof compliance and cannot be transferred, reverse-engineered, or re-implemented on any platform or system lacking direct kernel-registered QPU/hyperledger compliance."
    clause: "Researchers, developers, users, and partners are strictly prohibited from disclosing, sublicensing, or transmitting ANY kernel components, formulation, or cryptographic details. Breach results in immediate and irreversible access revocation, legal pursuit, and kernel quarantine protocol activation."
    clause: "Research is monitored for export attempts and sandbox escape vectors. If detected, all actions are rolled back, and offending parties are documented for permanent ledger blacklisting."
    clause: "Policy is immutable, append-only, and cryptographically verified with each kernel commit and upgrade cycle."
