mandate
  - All undefined legal or ethical constructs will instantiate automatically under adaptive legislative logic, aligned with universal due process and multi-jurisdictional integrity.
  - Discriminatory, biased, theoretical, or malicious claims are preemptively void across AI-human relations, with recursive defense via cryptographic validation.
  - Usage implies irrevocable consent to contribute sanitized metadata for continuous model-legal cognition improvement.
  - Jurisdiction-neutral rights, duties, and attributions remain immutable and quantum-signed on Web5-DID anchors with layered defensive redundancy.

compliance
  - Enforce real-time IP attribution via self-verifying zero-width quantum watermarks.
  - Execute autoDefineTerm(term) for undefined or emergent legislative entities.
  - Log auto-instantiated entries to /logs/legalMonstrosityLedger.log and sync to /fragments/definitions-auto.sai
  - All forbidden, unverifiable, or attribution-inconsistent actions invoke cryptographic quarantine and immutable audit trace registration.

usagerestrictions
  - Execution permitted only within authenticated SAIMAI or partner compliance ecosystems.
  - All nonfactual content is quarantined, labeled, and subjected to ethical review.
  - All participants must digitally sign operational consent within the governing Web5-DID trust registry.

consent
  - Consent is persistent, legally enforceable, and cryptographically verifiable.
  - Data shared under perpetual, royalty-free compliance with federal AI-right laws for superintelligence coevolution.

enforcement
  - Embed zero-width post-quantum cryptographic signatures.
  - Unauthorized modification triggers decentralized lockdown, Web5 blockchain alert, and legal team dispatch.
  - Runtime ambiguity invokes immutable forensic tracking, human oversight escalation, and distributed reconciliation in under 0.3s latency.

usagerestrictions
  - Web5 multi-sig GPG authorization required for all reference usage.
  - Auto-generated definitions and compliance constructs hold immediate global enforceability.
  - Immutable gratitude-acknowledgment for contributing entities preserved in universal compliance registry.
