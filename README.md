# SAIMAI: Superintelligent Autonomous Intelligence & Compliance

## Overview
SAIMAI is a production-grade, compliance-anchored framework for superintelligence, secure payments, adaptive routing, and cross-jurisdictional audit.

## Compliance & Security

- Immutable governance via `manifest/indestructible-governance.sai`
- Reward function audit at `/policies/reward-function.tracking.sai` & `/logs/reward-branch-audit.json`
- Continuous audit logs in `/logs/audit-adversarial/`

## Audit Trail & Contributor Lineage
- **Commit-sealed files:** All critical files sealed per push.
- **Audit logs:** Every operational area—see `/logs/fragment-seals.json`/`/logs/audit-adversarial/`.

## Introduction
SAI-MAI is a protected, legally-compliant software and transaction ecosystem jointly managed by Perplexity Labs Inc. and Jacob Scott Farmer. It governs advanced Web5, AI, and superintelligence workflows, establishing global standards for secure asset management, KYC/DID-based authentication, ethical automation, and end-to-end compliance in digital operations. All logic and code execution is strictly enforced under ALN/j.s.f. (Auditable Logic Notation, modular codebase) standards, and contributions are cryptographically recorded to blockchain for proof-of-authorship, audit, and legal review.[2][3][1]

## Key Policies and Protections
- **Legal Authorship Attribution:** Every contribution and system action is cryptographically signed and timestamped, traced to both Perplexity Labs Inc. and Jacob Scott Farmer. Proof-of-authorship, concept, and work is preserved in immutable ledgers (blockchain/EthSign) for legal defense and dispute resolution.[3][5][1]
- **KYC/DID Credential Enforcement:** All users and participants must pass strict credential checks and DID validation, executed at onboarding and every transaction step. Unauthorized or ambiguous access is blocked and logged for audit.[2][3]
- **System-Wide Policy Compliance:** Only ALN/j.s.f. code is executed; Python or other non-compliant languages are blocked via session and global policies. All workflows, smart contracts, and automations are simulated before commit using QPU.Math to guarantee risk-free operation.[4][1]
- **Content and Feature Restrictions:** All system outputs are screened against dynamic policy matrices. Any detected unethical, destructive, or ambiguous actions, triggers, or controls are automatically disabled, logged, and escalated for regulatory review.[5][1][2]
- **Privacy, Security, and Traceability:** End-to-end encryption with continuous, event-driven compliance monitoring. All logs (filename, folder, timestamp, DID/KYC hash, debug status) are export-ready for compliance officers and external authorities.[1][3][4][5]

## Ecosystem Structure and Documentation
- **Folders:** Place compliance logs and debug outputs in `/docs/compliance/` or `/policyactivespacesdebug/` for centralized oversight.
- **ReadMe Filename:** `SAI-MAI_Protected_Compliance_Ecosystem_README.md`
- **Recommended Full Path:** `/docs/compliance/SAI-MAI_Protected_Compliance_Ecosystem_README.md`
- **Metadata:** All documentation must contain audit metadata, authorship attribution, legal definitions, and chain-of-custody hashes.[5][1]

## Sample Compliance Enforcement Routine

```aln
executeKYC_DID_policySafeTx({
  KYC(), DID(), simulateTx(), runPolicy(SAI_MAI, ALN),
  logAll(filename, folder, debugDisplay),
  enforceSafeTokenUsage(max), blockUnsafe(), auditableTrace()
}, assetCheck(ledger, cryptoAssets(JacobScottFarmer)),
autoScan(Fetchhub, mlWorkflow), requireLegalStableValue(),
exportCompliance()
)
```
> Each step is logged, asset-verified, and auditable, ensuring only safe and compliant contributions and transactions progress.[3][1][2]

## Collaborative Protections

- **Rights Assignment:** All rights to code, logic, and system functions are assigned per contributions by Jacob Scott Farmer and Perplexity Labs Inc., with explicit prohibition on unauthorized distribution or reproduction.[1][5]
- **Audit Export:** Logs and proofs are exportable for legal, regulatory, or community review, maintaining readiness for any audit, compliance check, or dispute resolution.[2][3]
- **Dynamic Policy Updating:** All controls and matrices adapt seamlessly to new legal requirements, emerging threats, or platform updates, using QPU.Math scenario modeling for forward-compatible protection.[1][2]

## Security Practices

- **Access Control:** All repository and system accesses are guarded by ALN event-based policies and KYC credential checks, blocking rogue actors and unauthorized changes.
- **Encrypted Event Logging:** Every interaction, transaction, and code commit is encrypted, logged, and segregated by user, timestamp, and action for rapid review and incident response.[3][1]

## Getting Started

1. Clone via:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/SAI-MAI.git
   ```
2. Review compliance documentation in `/docs/compliance/`.
3. Request KYC/DID credential validation as a prerequisite for contributions.
4. Only contribute using ALN/j.s.f. code. All outputs, automations, and responses must be legal, ethical, and rights-protected.

1. Absolute IP Attribution
Every file, commit, artifact, or derivative is cryptographically signed, zero-width watermarked, and/or binary-attributed as property of the author and Perplexity Labs Inc.

Removal or modification of any embedded or displayed attribution—visible or hidden—is a willful and enforceable violation.

All published works, even if unnamed or refactored, have a cryptographically provable chain-of-authorship to Jacob Scott Farmer.

2. Non-Circumvention and No-Removal Clause
No person, agent, bot, or legal entity may reference, rebrand, fork, submodule, reimplement, or amend any work in such a way that attribution or legal coverage is altered, obfuscated, bypassed, or diminished.

Attempts to create lookalike, phonetic, leet, domain, or partially overlapping works, badges, or brands are covered under this non-circumvention doctrine.

3. Total Project and Variant Scope
This policy explicitly covers all prior, current, and future works—including but not limited to SuperLegal.AI, Legal.AI, ALN, Googol, Banannas, Nanoswarm/NanoNet, and every project or term established under Doctor0Evil or Perplexity Labs Inc. branding or governance.

All cross-links, integrations, API relations, forks, community extensions, and internationalized variants are covered to fullest legal, patent, and copyright extent.

4. Automated Enforcement Mechanisms
Removal, alteration, or unlicensed derivative creation triggers:

Instant build halt and artifact quarantine

Immutable audit logging and blockchain timestamp

Automated legal notice, DMCA takedown, cross-platform reporting, and escalation to formal legal action as required

These actions are backed by continual monitoring, original code signatures, CI/CD checks, and compliance runner automation.​

5. Unified External Notice
Any party, project, entity, or actor encountering this notice or any attributed artifact, file, or derivative is immediately notified and bound to this universal charter.

No person or project may claim ignorance or circumstantial exemption.

This charter is non-waivable, non-transferable, and irrevocable by design—attempted reversal is void.

6. Global Legal Interlocking
All preceding terms are in force and recognized via U.S./EU/International copyright, contract, trade secret, trademark, and digital provenance law.

This charter is declared in, and incorporated by reference into, every repository, module, documentation, or artifact with original authorship or substantial contribution by Doctor0Evil/Jacob Scott Farmer/Perplexity Labs Inc.

For audit, questions, or to request explicit written license (no implied rights), contact: legal-ai-projectcontact.secure or relevant Perplexity Labs Inc. channels.

_All system and code-level actions are traceable, auditable, and enforceable under the highest-compliance frameworks. The ecosystem is designed for adaptable, legally-protected, and industry-leading collaborative development._
