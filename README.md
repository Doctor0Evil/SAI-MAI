## Introduction

SAI/MAI is a secure public-access superintelligence configuration repository designed for advanced, persistent AI-chat platforms and knowledge systems. It enables contributors and users worldwide to interact and share secure configurations (SAI/MAI fragments/particles) with maximum transparency, automated compliance, and hardened network security via SwarmNet protocols. The repository automatically applies highest security standards: after setup, even original maintainers cannot access or modify critical components.

---

## Key Features

- **Persistent SAI/MAI Fragments & Particles:** Modular configuration files for safe superintelligence and governance.
- **Automated Maximum Security:** Critical-component access is locked after initialization; all sensitive controls are cryptographically sealed.
- **Advanced SwarmNet Protocols:** Distributed intelligence, secure consensus, and automated corruption-prevention.
- **Compliance Native:** Built-in adherence to GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO27001, and all relevant standards.
- **Transparent Contribution:** Public directory structure with immutable audit logs and consent ledgers.
- **Rapid Deployment:** Plug-and-play in Perplexity Spaces and similar environments.
- **No Manual Escalation:** All governance and override logic is consensus and cryptography-driven.
- **Tamper-Proof Automation:** Sigstore code signing and notarized processes.

---

## System Architecture

- **Fragments (`/fragments/*.sai`):** Superintelligence logic, security monitoring, and decision engines.
- **Particles (`/particles/*.mai`):** Governance, identity, consent, and cryptographic attestation protocols.
- **Workflow Configs (`/workflows/*.yml`):** CI/CD pipelines for compliance verification, testing, and auto-deployment.
- **Compliance Manifests (`config/sai-mai.yaml`):** Persistent, machine-readable manifests binding all network, security, and compliance settings.
- **Support Structures:** Containerization, sandboxing, and public transparency endpoints leveraging SwarmNet.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   `git clone https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/SAI-MAI.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** *(e.g., for Python)*  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Apply SAI/MAI configuration:**  
   Move/verify `config/sai-mai.yaml` is present and correct; locking and sealing is automatic on first run.
4. **Run compliance workflows:**  
   Use provided GitHub Actions and validator scripts.
5. **Deploy as container or plug-in:**  
   See Dockerfile and deployment scripts.

---

## Usage

- Load SAI/MAI configuration fragments and particles automatically in your chat or swarmnet applications.
- All governance and compliance operations occur autonomously, with audit logs and consensus records publicly available.
- Contribute new fragments/particles via standard PR methods.
- Emergency override is only available via documented multi-agent SwarmNet consensus.

---

## Governance and Compliance

- Governed by SwarmNet Superintelligence Charter for ethical, transparent, and lawful AI.
- Complies with GDPR, SOC2, PCI-DSS, ISO27001, FedRAMP, EU AI Act 2024, and global standards.
- Immutable audit trails, public transparency endpoints, and cryptographically notarized manifests.
- Automated corruption detection, quarantine, and swarm remediation protocols.

---

## Testing and Validation

- Full integration and compliance tests for reasoning, governance, and orchestration.
- CI/CD includes code signing, security scanning, notarization, and deployment validations.
- Audit and transparency logs publicly visible for validation.
