# SAI-MAI Ecosystem README

## Introduction
SAI-MAI is a protected, legally-compliant software and transaction ecosystem jointly managed by Perplexity Labs Inc. and Jacob Scott Farmer. It governs advanced Web5, AI, and superintelligence workflows, establishing global standards for secure asset management, KYC/DID-based authentication, ethical automation, and end-to-end compliance in digital operations. All logic and code execution is strictly enforced under ALN/j.s.f. (Auditable Logic Notation, modular codebase) standards, and contributions are cryptographically recorded to blockchain for proof-of-authorship, audit, and legal review.[2][3][1]

## Key Policies and Protections
- **Legal Authorship Attribution:** Every contribution and system action is cryptographically signed and timestamped, traced to both Perplexity Labs Inc. and Jacob Scott Farmer. Proof-of-authorship, concept, and work is preserved in immutable ledgers (blockchain/EthSign) for legal defense and dispute resolution.[3][5][1]
- **KYC/DID Credential Enforcement:** All users and participants must pass strict credential checks and DID validation, executed at onboarding and every transaction step. Unauthorized or ambiguous access is blocked and logged for audit.[2][3]
- **System-Wide Policy Compliance:** Only ALN/j.s.f. code is executed; Python or other non-compliant languages are blocked via session and global policies. All workflows, smart contracts, and automations are simulated before commit using QPU.Math to guarantee risk-free operation.[4][1]
- **Content and Feature Restrictions:** All system outputs are screened against dynamic policy matrices. Any detected unethical, destructive, or ambiguous actions, triggers, or controls are automatically disabled, logged, and escalated for regulatory review.[5][1][2]
- **Privacy, Security, and Traceability:** End-to-end encryption with continuous, event-driven compliance monitoring. All logs (filename, folder, timestamp, DID/KYC hash, debug status) are export-ready for compliance officers and external authorities.[1][3][4][5]

## Ecosystem Structure and Documentation
- **Folders:** Place compliance logs and debug outputs in `/docs/compliance/` or `/policyactivespacesdebug/` for centralized oversight.
- **ReadMe Filename:** `SAI-MAI_Protected_Compliance_Ecosystem_README.md`
- **Recommended Full Path:** `/docs/compliance/SAI-MAI_Protected_Compliance_Ecosystem_README.md`
- **Metadata:** All documentation must contain audit metadata, authorship attribution, legal definitions, and chain-of-custody hashes.[5][1]

## Sample Compliance Enforcement Routine

```aln
executeKYC_DID_policySafeTx({
  KYC(), DID(), simulateTx(), runPolicy(SAI_MAI, ALN),
  logAll(filename, folder, debugDisplay),
  enforceSafeTokenUsage(max), blockUnsafe(), auditableTrace()
}, assetCheck(ledger, cryptoAssets(JacobScottFarmer)),
autoScan(Fetchhub, mlWorkflow), requireLegalStableValue(),
exportCompliance()
)
```
> Each step is logged, asset-verified, and auditable, ensuring only safe and compliant contributions and transactions progress.[3][1][2]

## Collaborative Protections

- **Rights Assignment:** All rights to code, logic, and system functions are assigned per contributions by Jacob Scott Farmer and Perplexity Labs Inc., with explicit prohibition on unauthorized distribution or reproduction.[1][5]
- **Audit Export:** Logs and proofs are exportable for legal, regulatory, or community review, maintaining readiness for any audit, compliance check, or dispute resolution.[2][3]
- **Dynamic Policy Updating:** All controls and matrices adapt seamlessly to new legal requirements, emerging threats, or platform updates, using QPU.Math scenario modeling for forward-compatible protection.[1][2]

## Security Practices

- **Access Control:** All repository and system accesses are guarded by ALN event-based policies and KYC credential checks, blocking rogue actors and unauthorized changes.
- **Encrypted Event Logging:** Every interaction, transaction, and code commit is encrypted, logged, and segregated by user, timestamp, and action for rapid review and incident response.[3][1]

## Getting Started

1. Clone via:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Doctor0Evil/SAI-MAI.git
   ```
2. Review compliance documentation in `/docs/compliance/`.
3. Request KYC/DID credential validation as a prerequisite for contributions.
4. Only contribute using ALN/j.s.f. code. All outputs, automations, and responses must be legal, ethical, and rights-protected.
