description "Implements pre-execution quantum-seal verification layer ensuring the integrity of federated trust anchors before runtime activation."

mandate
  - Validate all trust anchors with lattice-based verification prior to federated execution.
  - Ensure cross-regional quantum ID consistency before data synchronization or particle activation.
  - Prevent boot of any execution-particle without an active verified quantum seal.
  - Report anomalies through encrypted channels to the SAIMAI compliance hub for human oversight validation.

verificationLayer.initialize():
  loadTrustAnchors from "/modules/interpreter.compliance.trustanchor.sai"
  for each anchor in trustAnchors:
    verifyQuantumSeal(anchor)
    if verification.failed():
      quarantine anchor
      logEvent "Quantum Seal Failure", anchor.id
      abortInitialization()
    end
  end
  registerSealVerified()
end

compliance
  - Enforce PQ-Sign + lattice integrity proof (QSeal-checksum).
  - Write verification snapshot to /ledger/qseal/logs/verified-seals.log  
  - Append cryptographic confirmation in /ledger/trustanchors.global.sai  
  - Auto-resync missing or desynced seals during multi-node initialization.

enforcement
  - Any unauthorized attempt to bypass QSeal invokes instant system lockdown.
  - Quantum seal integrity checks run cyclically every 300s during runtime.
  - Verified seals bind to every active particle with irreversible hash attribution.
